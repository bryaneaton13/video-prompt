This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

## Record videos

Simple app to record a few seconds of video, review it, and either delete or save it. (save does nothing right now)


Built with `react-native-camera`, `react-native-fs`, `react-native-orientation`, `react-native-video`
